PROJECT ABSTRACT

The Health Content Automation System is a Python-based automation project designed to streamline the creation of health-related digital content. The system automates the process of topic research, blog writing, and social media post generation using a modular and ethical approach.

The project addresses the problem of time-consuming manual content creation by converting health topics into structured research, informative blogs, and platform-specific social media posts. The automation is designed to assist content creators, wellness businesses, and educational platforms in maintaining consistency and quality.

The system follows a file-based workflow and does not perform direct automated posting, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and platform policies. It also supports manual review before publishing.

This project demonstrates practical applications of automation, modular programming, and real-world problem solving, making it suitable for academic evaluation and small business use cases.
