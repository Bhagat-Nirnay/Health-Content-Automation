SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN

The Health Content Automation System is designed using a modular architecture. Each module performs a specific task, allowing flexibility, scalability, and easy maintenance.

1. Topic Input Layer

Health topics are provided through a text file. This allows batch processing and easy modification without changing the codebase.

2. Research Module

The research module processes each topic and generates structured informational content. The output is stored as separate research files for traceability.

3. Blog Generation Module

This module converts research content into a well-structured health blog. It ensures clarity, readability, and logical content flow.

4. Social Media Post Generation Module

This module creates platform-specific social media posts optimized for Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp.

5. Output Management

Each module saves its output in dedicated folders, maintaining a clean and organized structure.

6. Automation Control

The automation can be triggered manually or via workflow automation tools such as n8n, allowing scheduling and orchestration without modifying the core logic.
